              We support our students with collaborative networking experiences.
              Our faculty cultivate our students in developing practical skills
              for the future. Students learn to become active, life-long,
              working professionals. They are encouraged to take on
              responsibility at the work place, to be innovative learners in
              their profession, and interact with employers to solve real-world
              problems.

            Applied Learning curriculum is an integral part of all masterâ€™s
            programs offered at the University of North America.&nbsp;Concurrent

              The academic curriculum prepares students for professional
              experience in the work place and this practical training combines
              practical skills with academic knowledge. Success in the academic
              programs relies on students having access to a work environment
              that allows them to apply the course content and activities. Both
              domestic and international students are required to obtain
              professional experiences while pursuing their academic
              degrees.&nbsp;

              Students meet with local employers to discuss opportunities and
              openings at their companies. Expert speakers present the
              innovative areas of interest their companies are looking into, or
              skills they are looking for. These opportunities are extremely
              helpful for students to find success in their career development.
