              Accreditation of an institution of higher education by the
              Commission indicates that it meets or exceeds criteria for the
              assessment of institutional quality periodically applied through a
              peer review process. An accredited college or university is one
              which has available the necessary resources to achieve its stated
              purposes through appropriate educational programs, is
              substantially doing so, and gives reasonable evidence that it will
              continue to do so in the foreseeable future. Institutional
              integrity is also addressed through accreditation.
            </p>
            <p class="alignLeft">
              Accreditation by the Commission is not partial but applies to the
              institution as a whole. As such, it is not a guarantee of every
              course or program offered, or the competence of individual
              graduates. Rather, it provides reasonable assurance about the
              quality of opportunities available to students who attend the
              institution.

              The University of North America mission-driven values of
              high-quality education and diversity in a student-centered,
              inclusive community are the foundation for the institutional
              goals. Currently, UoNA’s degree programs focus on computer
              science, information technology, and business disciplines and
              support the development of a broad understanding of the cultures
              in which these disciplines function.
            </p>
            <p>
              The focus of the University is applied learning. UoNA
              intentionally brings highly qualified faculty members that have
              solid academic credentials along with active careers in high tech
              industries, business, and government to create a stimulating
              learning environment. Coursework is designed to provide students
              the opportunity to explore and develop course-related competencies
              relevant to their work environment through applied learning
              assignments in each course of the curriculum.
            </p>
            <p>
              The University emphasizes high quality education that is
              accessible to learners in the global community, regardless of
              background, to enable them to succeed in their careers. This goal
              is achieved as the University provides an advanced education that
              cultivates growth and development in the professional and personal
              lives of our students. With its teaching focused on the principles
              of applied learning, UoNA bridges the gap between the theoretical
              learning of traditional disciplines and the applied knowledge
              required to provide graduates with a comprehensive understanding
              and a competitive advantage in today’s global society.
